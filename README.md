# LanSharebotNg---2.0.9.5

Marlin (https://marlinfw.org/) config files for a modified Sharebot NG (ttps://www.sharebot.it/en/)

I've added/changed:

1) PSU management (the original was cooked!!)
2) Filament runout (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003565228895.html)
3) DRV8825 for X, Y and Z 

Removed bed leveling.

I've enabled some other marlin features to work better alone and with Octoprint (https://octoprint.org/)
